### Problem Description 

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.


```

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        carry = 0
        root = n = ListNode(0)
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = v2 = 0
            if l1:
                v1 = l1.val
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                v2 = l2.val
                l2 = l2.next
            carry, val = divmod(v1+v2+carry, 10)
            n.next = ListNode(val)
            n = n.next
        return root.next

```
