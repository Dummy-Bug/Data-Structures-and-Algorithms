**Given a Binary string A flip the bits from L to R such that the number of ones are maximum.**

**Notes**
> * let's say we have flipped a substring S` from L to R , then it would mean we have changed all occurrences of 0 to 1 and vice versa.Now 
>  if the count of new 1s(obtained after fliping 0s) is more than count of new 0s in this substring S` then it would mean we have increased the 
>  total number of 1s in string S. But we do not just want to increase the occurrence of number of 1s rather we want to maximise the number of 1s 
>  in the whole string S.Hence in original string S we have to find a substring S` such that after fliping all bits of this substring the difference
>  of number of new 1s and new 0s is maximum.

> * Hence the problem gets reduced to finding the Substring S` that will give us the maximum difference of new 1s and new 0s.

> > **Approach 1**
> > * Find all the Substrings in string S and return the indices of the substring with maximum difference.

> > **Approach 2**
> > * Use Kadane's Algorithm such that if we encounter 0 in substring our difference increases and if we encounter 1 our difference decreases.
